#HTML Presentation
##History of HTML
	###Web Invented with HTML with HTML as its Publishing Language
		In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, who was a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.
		Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.


##HTML
	HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
	The markup language is used for describing web documents
	The language is built up using a set of markup tags
	HTML documents are described by HTML tags, and each tag describes a different document type
    HTML is not case sensitive
    HTML documents contain HTML tags and plain text
    A tag is always enclosed in an angle bracket, (i.e. <>, <HTML>)
    Tags usually come pairs, start tag and end tag or opening tag and closing tag, where the closing
    tag will usually begin with /, (i.e. <HTML>...</HTML>)

    Simple HTML example
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>

        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>

        </body>
        </html>

    ~The first tag indicates that the document type will be HTML
    ~The text between <html> and </html> describes an HTML document
    ~The text between <head> and </head> provides information about the document
    ~The text between <title> and </title> provides a title for the document
    ~The text between <body> and </body> describes the visible page content
    ~The text between <h1> and </h1> describes a heading
    ~The text between <p> and </p> describes a paragraph

##HTML Tags
    Container Element
        ~Container Tags contains a start and end tag, (i.e. <p>...</p>)
    Empty Element
        ~Tags which only require start tag, (i.e. <br> which starts a new line)
    Heading Element
        ~Prints the heading of the page, ranges from <H1> to <H6>. <H1> prints the 
        largest heading and <h6> prints the smallest heading
        ~Heading tags also require end tag
        The following tags begin with <h1> tags and increase to <h6> tags

        <html>
        <head><title>heading example</title></head>
        <body>
        <h1>Header 1</h1>
        <h2>Header 2</h2>
        <h3>Header 3</h3>
        <h4>Header 4</h4>
        <h5>Header 5</h5>
        <h6>Header 6</h6>
        </body>
        </html>
