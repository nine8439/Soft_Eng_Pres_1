##HTML
	HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
	The markup language is used for describing web documents
	The language is built up using a set of markup tags, ??
	HTML documents are described by HTML tags, and each tag describes a different document type

    Simple HTML example
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>

        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>

        </body>
        </html>

    ~The first tag indicates that the document type will be HTML
    ~The text between <html> and </html> describes an HTML document
    ~The text between <head> and </head> provides information about the document
    ~The text between <title> and </title> provides a title for the document
    ~The text between <body> and </body> describes the visible page content
    ~The text between <h1> and </h1> describes a heading
    ~The text between <p> and </p> describes a paragraph
